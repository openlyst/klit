# Changelog

# 11.0.0 (Unreleased)
- Made Popular page top control bar background transparent so posts are visible underneath ([!21](https://gitlab.com/Openlyst/klit/-/merge_requests/21))
- Sped up Popular and Hot pages by using the dedicated `/popular.json` API endpoint for day/week/month scales instead of the general `/posts.json` with date tag queries ([!20](https://gitlab.com/Openlyst/klit/-/merge_requests/20))
- Fixed the app flashing/reloading when switching accounts by keeping previous content visible during re-activation ([!19](https://gitlab.com/Openlyst/klit/-/merge_requests/19))
- Fixed check-for-update failing after the app slug changed from `klit` to `kilt` on the Openlyst API ([!18](https://gitlab.com/Openlyst/klit/-/merge_requests/18))
- Moved sidebar Klit branding box down to stop it clashing with the nav buttons ([!17](https://gitlab.com/Openlyst/klit/-/merge_requests/17))

- Added support for new fields: uploader_name, change_seq, approver_id, locked_tags

# 9.0.2
- Fix macos network in debug mode

# 9.0.1
- Fix macos network

# 9.0.0
## Remake
- Remake the whole app.

# 8.1.0

- Remove Server Configuration from Settings: the host/API server is no longer configurable in Settings; to use a different host (e.g. e621 vs e926), add a new account for that host and switch accounts
- Keep tab pages alive with IndexedStack so switching tabs or resizing desktop/mobile does not dispose pages; images and scroll position are preserved
- Search page: when opened with a new query (e.g. from tag tap), update search field and run search via didUpdateWidget
- Optimistic favorite and upvote in post detail: UI and confetti update immediately; API runs in background and state reverts on failure
- Posts provider: use separate loading-more flags for latest/hot/popular so existing lists show without a full loading state when loading more
- Profile: in-memory cache so returning to a previously loaded profile shows instantly, then refreshes in background
- Post card: stable cacheKey for CachedNetworkImage so cache lookup is consistent across rebuilds
- Feeds (edit): tag suggestions in And/Or/Exclude fields via shared TagSuggestionField widget; reuses search-tag logic (debounce, prefix, insert at cursor)
- Post detail: catch precache image failures (invalid image data) so they do not throw or spam the console
- Post detail: full OLED theme support — scaffold, nav bar, desktop top bar, info panel, controller hints and comments sheet use pure black / OLED colors when OLED mode is on
- Settings > Video: add "Autoplay GIFs" (default on) to animate GIFs in home, search, and other grids; when off, post cards show static preview for GIFs
- GIF autoplay: only animate GIFs when the post card is in view (visibility detector); off-screen cards show static preview to reduce lag. While the GIF loads or on error, show the static preview so there is no black or grey flash
- Feeds: when creating or editing a feed you can set rating (All / Safe / Q / E) and sort (Newest, Oldest, Score, Favorites); opening a feed applies these filters like on the search page
- Feeds: optional "Exclude my favorites" (default off); when on, the feed excludes posts you have favorited
- Feeds: subfeeds — attach optional subfeeds to a feed (name + extra include/exclude tags); when viewing the feed, tabs show Main and each subfeed; only one subfeed active at a time; subfeed adds its tags to the main query
- Feeds tab: subfeeds listed under each feed card (indented, smaller) so you can open a feed with a specific subfeed active directly from the list
- Feeds and Search stay inside the shell: opening a feed switches to the Search tab with filters instead of pushing a full-screen route; creating/editing a feed shows the form in the Feeds tab so the nav bar and sidebar remain visible
- Search page: single top bar with search field and filter/search buttons instead of separate title bar and toolbar
- Search page (desktop): hide history sidebar when history is off or empty; results use full width
- OLED mode: glass header variant (search/feed top bar) uses solid black when OLED is on; search toolbar text field uses OLED secondary background
- Settings: full OLED theming — account/cards, sidebar, content header border, category list, nav order and proxy dialogs, update check dialogs use black/secondary OLED colors when OLED mode is on

# 8.0.1

- top bar refactor

# 8.0.0

- README: expanded with features, prerequisites, getting started, and build instructions
- Settings Account: visual refresh — larger avatar with ring, clearer typography, refined cards and spacing; Accounts section with description and filled Add button; account list cards with subtler active state and cleaner Active badge
- Settings Account (mobile): fix semantics assertion (parentDataDirty) by giving embedded account list bounded height (host settings, login, blacklist, settings, toolbar, sidebar, nav bar More menu, search, account management, post detail, loading shimmer)
- OLED theme: use pure black for all backgrounds and bar (was grey secondary/separator)
- Android: opt out of edge-to-edge so status bar can be hidden on Android 15+; re-apply hide after first frame so it sticks
- Fix black-on-black text in Settings Account, Feeds, Profile, Favorites, and Blacklist empty states and help text (use theme-aware label/secondaryLabel on dark/OLED)
- Android: hide system status bar (time, battery, network) for a cleaner full-screen look
- Settings (Android): system back button now returns to the main settings list from sub-pages (e.g. Account) instead of exiting Settings
- Post detail: show instantly when opened from list (Home, Hot, Popular, Search, Feeds, Favorites, Profile) using already-loaded post data; no loading spinner for current post
- Liquid glass: remove purple glow and tint from mobile nav bar (neutral shadow and border only)
- Feed edit: redesigned New feed tab with section cards; Sources show which account is used per host (username or Guest); form spans full width with reduced padding; Sources text easier to read (larger, higher contrast in dark mode)
- Feeds: multi-host support — choose multiple hosts per feed (e.g. e926, e621, e6ai); results merged by date; feed list is global (same for all accounts)
- Feeds: post detail and comments use correct host and account per post (vote, favorite, comment)
- Post detail: preload comments when a post loads; comments sheet shows them immediately and lazy-loads more pages on scroll
- Post detail: use full-screen loading page again while post loads (revert in-content placeholders)
- Post detail: remove refresh button from nav bar (more-options ellipsis only in trailing)
- Search page when opened as route: remove duplicate top nav bar so only the search toolbar (with back button) is shown and the search bar is not hidden
- Post detail: vote buttons and score/comment indicators use thumbs up / thumbs down icons instead of arrows
- Post detail: show initial UI (toolbar + layout) first with in-content placeholders while loading; no full-screen loading screen
- Post grid: cache dimensions from post preview aspect ratio so thumbnails are not stretched or squashed
- Post grid: wrap each cell in AspectRatio to avoid parentDataDirty semantics assertion when scrolling
- Post grid: lighter placeholder (solid grey) for grid cards so scores show fast; images fade in (150ms) as they load
- Post grid: placeholder and error state use theme background (dark / OLED / light) instead of white when no image is loaded
- Sidebar: collapsed state shows only icon for collapse button to fix right overflow
- Performance: offload API JSON parsing to background isolate (compute); blacklist filtering runs on main isolate to avoid isolate transfer issues so infinite scroll and load-more work reliably
- Performance: posts grid uses cacheExtent and passes theme/style into post cards to avoid per-card provider watches; grid thumbnails use memCacheWidth/Height for faster decode
- Performance: storage (accounts, feeds, search history) JSON decode moved to background isolate; blacklist settings text input debounced; I-finished gallery batches setState
- Performance: video thumbnails use CachedNetworkImage; post card liquid-glass shadows reduced from 4 to 2 for less GPU work
- macOS: minimum deployment target raised to 11.0 (required by connectivity_plus and other plugins)
- Post detail: tag chips coloured by tag category (character/species/general/artist/etc.) instead of post rating
- Post detail: preload preview and full image for adjacent posts (±3) so swiping shows images from cache
- "I finished" milk animation: sticky splatter shoots at screen from center-bottom, holds ~5s then fades
- "I finished" milk animation: stringy viscous strands (curved, teardrop, pinched), glossy highlights, subtle wobble during hold
- "I finished" milk animation: spread-out fan (center stream + many streams arcing left/right)
- "I finished" milk animation: strands from separate origins (not one nozzle), sticky center blob, scattered droplets
- Settings Behavior: Gallery button for finished posts — swipe through all I-finished images (camera photo or post image)
- App starts in guest mode (main screen); login page only when user chooses to log in
- Mobile nav bar: default reduced to Home, Search, Profile, Settings; added horizontal padding and spacing; labels shown when &lt;5 items
- Mobile nav bar: "More" (⋯) menu opens Hot, Popular, Favorites, Feeds (and Settings for guests); default bar includes More
- Post detail: preload up to 3 posts on each side of current so swiping doesn't wait for load
- Profile: three tabs (Main, Uploads, Favorites) with pill-style tab bar; all three styled as buttons (subtle bg when unselected); Main shows overview, Uploads/Favorites show post grids
- Search history and feeds are per-account; switching accounts shows only that account's data
- Feeds: add "Both" type option so a feed can show both images and videos (Image / Video / Both)
- Feeds: add And tags (all required) and Or tags (any of); rename include to And, add Or tags field and exclude hint; feed cards show or tags
- Post detail (mobile): use single Download in more-options sheet; remove Download from action icon row
- Post detail: action button labels (Downvote, Download, etc.) stay on one line with ellipsis instead of wrapping
- Settings: fix mobile flash of wrong category when opening with initialCategory (defer content one frame, show placeholder until ready)
- Settings (mobile): fix sub-pages opening wrong category for a split second — set category and show sub-page in one setState
- Settings: show Back button when opened as a route (e.g. from Profile) so user is not stuck; mobile bar and desktop sidebar
- Settings: reorder categories (Network before Data); add Feeds to desktop sidebar order; add Mobile nav bar order to Customization

- Account remove: capture AuthProvider and Navigator before showing dialog to fix deactivated widget error when tapping Remove
- Account management moved into Settings > Account only; standalone Accounts route removed; Profile "Manage Accounts" / gear opens Settings on Account
- Profile: remove "Manage Accounts" button from actions card (account settings still via toolbar gear)
- Settings Account: single "Add" button in header only (removed duplicate "Add account" row above list)
- Settings Behavior: grey out "Ask for photo when marking I finished" on desktop and web (camera unavailable)
- Settings Behavior: wrap Finished posts list in Material so InkWell has required ancestor (fix No Material widget found)
- "I finished" on desktop: camera disabled; adds without photo so it works without permission_handler
- Optional "I finished" button (default off) with milk-style animation and optional camera photo; track finished posts and photos in Settings > Behavior
- Code: fix empty catch comment, unnecessary_underscores, and redundant import; clean analyze
- Mobile nav: when 6+ items show icon-only compact bar (less height, no labels); re-add Settings to default navbar; fix Profile/Favorites/Feeds taps; remove Favorites from default navbar
- Feeds: migrate legacy mobile nav order so Feeds appears in navbar for existing users
- Feeds: use e621 file-type metatags ( ~type:jpg ~type:png ~type:gif ~type:webp ) for image and ( ~type:mp4 ~type:webm ) for video so API returns results
- Feed view: opening a feed shows a toolbar with back button and feed name so you can exit the feed; results only below

- Settings Account: avatar glow and border use colors extracted from the profile image
- Mobile nav bar: remove solid background behind the bar so only the rounded pill is visible
- Post detail: tapping a tag navigates to the search tab with that tag (no modal/search route)
- Post detail: show uploader profile picture (avatar) when available; fallback to initial letter
- Settings Account: show user profile picture (avatar) when available from API or avatar post
- Settings UI: mobile pill tabs (purple when selected), section header as card, iOS-style rows; desktop macOS-style sidebar with search and blue selection highlight

- Unified all pages to single file pattern with state preservation - pages no longer lose state when resizing window between desktop/mobile
- Refactored account_management_page.dart to unified pattern (removed separate desktop/mobile build methods)
- Added KeyedSubtree wrappers to all pages to preserve state across layout mode changes
